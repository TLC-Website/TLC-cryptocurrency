# TLC

## TLC — The Loin Coin

TLC (The Loin Coin) is a web-based crypto simulation platform built with Python (Django).
It allows users to explore how a cryptocurrency website works — including balance management, buying and selling a fictional coin, and viewing live graph updates that react to simulated market activity.

A visual concept sketch of the website design is included in the repository.
The design will evolve during development as the project improves.

## Project Description

TLC is an educational and experimental crypto project created to simulate a functioning cryptocurrency environment in a safe and controlled way.
Users can:

View information about the project and its creators

Deposit and withdraw funds (simulated)

Buy and sell the TLC coin — all transactions are artificial

See a dynamic price graph that changes depending on buy/sell activity

This simulation provides an engaging way to learn about the logic behind trading systems and web development.

## About the Project

TLC — The Loin Coin — was created as a creative and educational project to understand cryptocurrency logic, user interface design, and full-stack web development.
The website is a fictional simulation meant for learning and demonstration purposes only.
